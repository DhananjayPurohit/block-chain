## Detailed Timeline
### Week 1: 
- Understanding data flow in hyperledger fabric.
- Read the documents and get doubts clarified.
- Read the architecture of hyperledger fabric at: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture.html
- By the end of this week, we expect you to gain a thorough understanding of the architecture in hyperledger fabric.

### Week 2:
- Understanding network setup using Docker containers.
- Read "byfn.sh" from "fabric-samples" and gain a thorough understanding of shell files and what they are doing.
- Get an overview of docker-compose and .yaml files
- By the end of the second week, you are expected to be able to set up your own network and start playing around by deploying simple chaincodes.

### Week 3: 
- Understanding different methods of writing chaincodes in golang.
- A very important aspect of e-KYC is Private Data Collections. We expect you to implement a simple use case using Private Data Collections.
- Installing and instantiating the chaincode on different peers through a command line interface( CLI ).
- Calling invoke and query functions through CLI.

### Week 4 to 6:
- By now we expect you to have a thorough understanding of hyperledger fabric and its functionalities.
- This is when you start contributing to the project's code base.
- Open new issues regarding what functionality you think are necessary to be implemented.
- The maintainers will validate the authenticity, practicality, and creativity of the issue and will assign it to you.

### Week 7 to 8:
- Develop a production level setup by using container orchestration.
- Deploy containers on different servers to minimalize single node failures.
- We encourage you to do so by either using docker swarms or kubernetes.
